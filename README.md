# myspace2.0

## Description

This project is a RESTful API for a social network web application. Users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. This project demonstrates how to handle large amounts of unstructured data with MongoDB, making it ideal for social networking platforms.
